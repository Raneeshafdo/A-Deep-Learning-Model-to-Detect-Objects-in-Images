# A-Deep-Learning-Model-to-Detect-Objects-in-Images

Custom training YOLOv8 pre-trained model with a custom food dataset

This report details the development of a deep learning model for object detection in images, focusing on food items. Utilizing the YOLOv8s model, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system, the study aims to accurately identify and localize various food items within a dataset provided by Roboflow. The methodology encompasses data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Data preprocessing involved resizing and normalizing images, followed by splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The YOLOv8s model was fine-tuned with hyperparameters to enhance performance, and its efficacy was assessed using evaluation metrics and visual inspection of prediction results. The project highlights the challenges encountered, such as varying appearances and occlusions of food items, and suggests potential improvements including advanced data augmentation strategies, model ensemble approaches, and optimization techniques for real-world deployment. The findings underscore the model's capability in real-time applications while also identifying avenues for further research and enhancement in object detection accuracy and efficiency.
